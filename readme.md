## Introduction

This project is made to just test my skills (im still kind of new). While this is a work in progress, I'm excited to share my journey with you. Expect some hiccups along the way—I'm still learning! Making this app has taught me many things(mainly to cope with depression and rage). I will be making updates and fixing issues and bugs in my free time!

## Known Issues

Ofcourse there are issues(a lot) some of the major stuffs are:

- **Animepahe server unavailable:** The api of Animepahe has been modified and now is inaccessible. This source will be removed on next release.

- **Episode Selection Glitch:** Occasionally, the wrong anime gets selected when choosing an episode. This issue will be fixed soon!.

*Pro Tip: Dont use MAL as database(It doesnt work well with my concept).*
